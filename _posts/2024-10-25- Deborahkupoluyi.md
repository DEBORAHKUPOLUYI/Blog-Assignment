The birchbark basket is a sacred and practical object with deep spiritual and cultural significance within the Canadian Plateau women's community. Birchbark baskets are crafted by women, using birch tree bark as raw material. The birchbark basket is more than just a utilitarian object; it is imbued with spiritual meaning as it plays a crucial role in religious practices and rituals. The techniques of making birch bark basketry are learned and passed on from one generation of women to the next (Croft and Mathewes, 2013, p. 100). I think it is essential to teach these skills to their generation because the process of making a basket requires both physical and spiritual knowledge.

The ritual benefit of the birchbark basket is portrayed in burials and the transitioning of young girls to womanhood. For burials, birchbark baskets hold food for the afterlife of the individual and as an offering to spirits (Croft and Mathewes, 2013, p. 104). Croft and Mathewes highlighted that since women made birch bark containers, it can be suggested that placing these containers with the dead was a way of providing the deceased with the nurturing presence of women (2013, p. 104); this can suggest that the basket may be a symbol of female nurturing.  Additionally, the learning of the craft of birch basket construction was part of a girl’s transition into what it meant to be a woman both socially and economically; it was also part of her spiritual development. (Croft and Mathewes, 2013, p. 106), because the knowledge of the basket is essential to the development of her community.

The birchbark basket can be connected to the authority and power of Canadian Plateau women because the making and use of the basket is primarily a female responsibility, and through this role, Canadian Plateau women assert their spiritual authority. The birchbark basket represents women’s role as caretakers and sustainers of both physical and spiritual life.  Women wield considerable power, particularly in matters of passing down traditional knowledge about the birchbark and its different uses for the community.

Conclusively, the birchbark basket in the Canadian Plateau community is more than just a practical tool; it is a sacred object that reflects the spiritual relationship between women, and the community. Its creation and use are deeply connected to the authority of women as caretakers, and spiritual leaders. Through their skilled craftsmanship and spiritual knowledge, Canadian Plateau women use the birchbark basket to nurture both the physical and spiritual well-being of her community.
